# ExifPictureManagement
Tag pictures, search and sort by exif data.

The project required that images be displayed, filtered and sorted with data stored in a config file.

Since that's a bad way to store image data, and to make things interesting I took the project further and created and read tags using image metadata keeping the tagging via config file only to conform with the specification.
